That means crafting a menu of soups, salads and sandwiches that Panera is proud to feed its own families. Like poultry and pork raised without antibiotics on our salads and sandwiches. A commitment to transparency and options that empower Panera&rsquo;s guests to eat the way they want. Seasonal flavors and whole grains. And a commitment to removing artificial additives (artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives and colors from artificial sources) from the food in its bakery-cafes. Why? Because Panera thinks that simpler is better and believes in serving food as it should be. Because when you don&rsquo;t have to compromise to eat well, all that is left is the joy of eating.<\\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\\\"http:\\\/\\\/panerabread.com\\\">panerabread.com<\\\/a> or find us on Twitter (@panerabread), Facebook (facebook.com\\\/panerabread) or Instagram (@panerabread).<\\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"shortDescription\":\"<p>Panera Bread is a company that cares about the simple things: freshly-baked breads, imaginative pairings, a warm place to gather and supporting our local neighborhoods.
